### Initial setup

# Then, you need to install all the dependencies...
npm install

# If you wanna be able to use global commands `karma` and `gulp`...
npm install -g gulp
```

### Running in the browser
```bash
gulp build
gulp serve

# If you wanna Gulp to re-build on every change...
gulp watch
```

### What are all the pieces involved?

#### [Babel]
Transpiles ES6 code into regular ES5 (today's JavaScript) so that it can be run in a today browser. Like traceur but doesn't need a runtime to work. Formerly known as 6to5.

#### [CommonJS]
Babel is configured to transpile ES6 modules into CommonJS syntax and we use browserify to bundle the code into one file to deliver it to the browser.

#### [Browserify]
Browserify walks through all files and traces down all `require()`s to bundle all files together.  

#### [Gulp]
Task runner to make defining and running the tasks simpler.
